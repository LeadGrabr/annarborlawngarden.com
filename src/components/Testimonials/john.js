        For years fall leaves have been a trouble to me, since i had to handle
        the massive amounts of falling foliage. If you live in a green area that
        is densely packed with arbors, you know what i am talking about. Oftentimes,
        it includes back breaking work to rake leaves, remove fallen twigs and branches,
        and a good garbage bag to pick up all the interesting articles that are brought
        to your yard by mother nature's good old wind! The burden of doing this work
        is not a worry to me now. Ever since i visited them their services have been
        satisfying. What i can say to you is that when you hire them and the job is
        successfully completed, you can also count them again for regular
        maintenance. A crew will come every spring and fall for a seasonal
        cleanup. Your floral display will be changed and all your trees,
        shrubs and perennials will be fertilized. Bed revitalization programs
        will be applied, using top quality mulching. Your dream garden will
        always look at its best, and who knows... maybe someday it will also
        be featured on the front cover of a gardening magazine.
